Robert James Joy is not a licensed therapist, but he thinks that good
therapists are pretty cool, and that anyone with the luck or the privilege to
be in therapy with one should probably do so. He lives in Oakland, CA, with his
partner (who *is* a [licensed therapist](http://lisapetrastherapy.com/)) and
children. He likes to play with words, look at trees, and wiggle his body
around while listening to music.
