Wikipedia (as of writing this, anyway) defines
[psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) as "the science of
behavior and mind... as well as feeling and thought." Behavior and mind and
feeling and thought is a *lot* of territory. Some might say that covers most of
the human lived experience. All of your joy, sadness, pleasure, pain, fun,
boredom, ideas, stories, and actions fit in there. While I admit that a younger
me wasn't particularly interested in learning about psychology, these days it
seems like one of the most valuable and underappreciated topics of study. What
could be more useful than learning about how I work? About why I think these
thoughts, why I feel those feelings, why I do these things?

It's not possible to answer these questions completely, of course, neither in
general nor in any specific case. Psychology is not an exact science, nor even
always a consistent one. But still, a large number of very smart people have
spent many years experimenting, studying, watching, and communicating about
humans and their behaviors and their experiences.

The Therapish project rises from two basic premises. The first is that learning
about psychology is pragmatically useful. Many ideas are not just abstract
concepts, but can be directly experienced in our own relationships,
