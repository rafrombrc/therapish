A therapist (or, more precisely, a "psychotherapist") is a trained, licensed
professional who has undergone a rigorous study and practice of psychology
towards the end of improving the mental and emotional health of paying clients.
Someone who is "therapish" has *not* gone through such training, doesn't have
such a license, but is still interested in learning about these topics due to
their own interest. This interest is often fueled by a belief that this
knowledge can improve their quality of life, by supporting a depth of
understanding of their own behaviors, feelings, and relationships, and possibly
the ability to change these in some desirable ways.

This site is in honor of, is in support of, and is an effort to expand the
ranks of those who consider themselves therapish. If you'd like to deepen your
understanding of the basic mechansisms of your own functioning, this site is
for you. If you'd like to develop a relationship with your own style of
relationship, this site is for you. If you find yourself fascinated by the very
existence of this thing that we call "sentience" or "consciousness" and might
enjoy exploring its foundations and most basic functional mechanisms, this site
is for you. And, most of all, if you're interested in applying these
understandings to an improved experience of life for yourself, then this site
is for you.

Thanks for exploring.
