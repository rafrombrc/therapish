Wikipedia (as of this writing) defines
[psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) as "the science of
behavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious phenomena, as well as
feeling and thought." Behavior and mind and feeling and thought is a *lot* of
territory. In fact, it covers most of human lived experience. All of our joy,
sadness, pleasure, pain, fun, boredom, ideas, stories, and actions fit in those
categories.

As that definition hints, one of the primary ideas in modern psychology is that
unconscious phenomena significantly influence human behavior. Consider that for
a moment... unconscious phenomena are, by definition, parts of us that we are
unaware of. We tend to think of the choices we make and the actions we take as
determined by our conscious minds. Psychology claims that parts of ourselves
that *we don't even know about* are having a much bigger impact on our behavior
than we think. If that's so, it makes me quite curious. What are those unknown
parts of me? How are they impacting my behavior? Are those impacts that I'm
happy about, or would I rather they back off a bit?

When I met [my partner](http://lisapetrastherapy.com/) in 2011, she had nearly
acquired her California Marriage and Family Therapy license. As I grew close to
her and the many other therapists in our shared community, I learned a bit
about modern psychological thinking. I often found that thinking about my own
life with these frames in mind gave "a-ha" moments, sometime accompanied by
strong feelings and emotions. This piqued my interest and led me to learn more
by reading books and by undertaking my own individual therapy. Over time my
friends and I would joke that I might not be a therapist, but I was certainly
therapish.

This site is an effort to share the understanding and enthusiasm that I have
grown with others. Psychotherapists undergo a rigorous training and licensure
process before they can practice on clients; this is probably wise. But we
don't need a license to be interested in learning about the models that
therapists apply, or to be curious about looking at our own selves through the
lenses of these models. I genuinely experience my life to have improved from
learning about them and applying them to myself. I feel like unconscious
structures and motivations have come into my awareness, which has led me to
have more conscious agency and choice in my life. This in turn has led to more
positive outcomes.

My hope is that you too will find these ideas both fascinating and useful.

Thanks for exploring.
