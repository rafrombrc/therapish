Most people will use the word "myself" or refer to an "I" or a "me" without
thinking too much about it. We think of our "selves" as having certain traits,
which together make up a sense of what we call identity. "I'm outgoing." "I'm
anxious." "I'm ambitious." "I'm thoughtful and deliberate." It sometimes can
seem as though we have an unending supply of stories about ourselves. But what
is this "self" that we're speaking of, anyway?

This question has caused various mystics and philosophers to chase themselves
around conceptual trees throughout all of human history. Attempting to reckon
with the nature of self is a central theme to Eastern traditions of thought
such as Buddhism and Taoism. Often a distinction is made between an egoic,
conceptual self and a deeper, purely sensate self. There are extensive
practices centered around meditating on and aspiring to the elusive essence of
that deeper self.

While there is no doubt such meditations and aspirations can be quite fruitful,
for our purposes we wish to consider the self as the combination of those
parts. We can define "self" as a structure of sentience or consciousness that
is tied to a specific body, which inhabits and animates that body, and *which
gives rise to a sense of conceptual continuity within that body*. It is a
center of sensation and feeling, capable of perceiving and reacting to and
impacting the world within which it exists, but also of thought, capable of
conceptualizing abstractions about that world.

Human infants do not yet have a self in the way that we mean. They have
sentience, i.e. perceptions and sensations, but they do not have the thought
structures nor the sense of continuous identity that exist in adults. These
adult components of our selves must be grown within us, formed on top of the
infantile sentience, out of the raw materials of our environments as they are
experienced over time. Selves are developed in reaction to that which we
perceive. Selves develop in relation to that which our nervous system comes to
understand as "other".

An interesting thought experiment can be to imagine the lived experience of an
infant. I imagine it to be an unformed wash of sensations. There are colors and
sounds and tactile feelings, undifferentiated, uncategorized. The closest
experience to this I can think of that is available to my adult mind would be
to watch an immersive stream of consciousness movie, with far too many images
and sounds rapidly cycling for me to be able to process and categorize all of
them. Unable to keep up, my thinking mind is forced to shut down, and I
surrender to letting the sensations wash over me and evoke feelings at a deeper
layer than where my thoughts exist.

For an infant, we might imagine all of the world as such a movie. It's not that
it's moving too fast, there is simply no thinking mind in place to do the
processing and categorizing that older humans take for granted. Eventually,
however, some of these sensations repeat enough times to cause a coherence in
our relationship to them. In most cases, a particular set of sights and sounds
and smells and feelings slowly consolidate into what we eventually learn to
call "mama". Usually there are one or more other caregivers who similarly start
to take form. A father is most common, but anyone who shows up consistently in
an infant's life will do.

There are non-human "others" out there in the world, of course. Chairs, plants,
pets, doors, clothes, rocks, anything that we have an experience of that we can
tell is not part of "me". But none of these have a self, or at least not a
human self, the way that we do, and so none of these are as impactful in the
development of our own selves. We are hard wired to bond with and "attach" to
our caregivers, often referred to in psychology as "primary attachment
figures". Our sense of self is literally constructed out of our relationship to
and experience of these attachment figures.

Given this, it's no wonder that it's a clich√© how psychologists and
psychotherapists are so very interested in a client's relationship to their
parents. The key to understanding the workings of an adult self is
understanding the others from which that self was constructed, and how the
experience of those others supported (or not) that construction. So much of
what you understand to be "you" is the result of your unformed self trying to
make sense its experience of its caregivers, and trying to figure out how best
to get those caregivers to continue to give the care upon which the vulnerable
infant depends.
