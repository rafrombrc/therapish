In our brief exploration of [the essence and formation of self]({{< relref
"inquiry_into_self.md" >}}), we touched on how a sense of self (or a "subject")
can only develop in response to some sense of an other (or an "object"). As
infants experience certain sensory impressions over and over again, we start to
realize that particular bundles of sensations (sights, smells, sounds, tastes,
and tactile feelings) have an existence all on their own. They are associated
with a single other, a single object, that persists over time. In fact, the
budding little baby grows to realize, that object exists *even when the baby is
not perceiving it*. This realization we call "object permanence".

A baby's delight at the game "peek-a-boo" is often brought up to illustrate
object permanence. Peek-a-boo is wasted effort with a newborn, who hasn't even
developed a relationship to the experience of seeing a face, much less come to
realize that the human face belongs to a persistent other. Nor does peek-a-boo
excite an older child, who well understands that the face is attached to a
person, and the person is still just right there even if the face isn't
visible. Peek-a-boo enthralls those old enough to delight in a friendly face,
but young enough to be shocked and delighted each time it reappears anew.

There is no consensus on exactly when humans develop object permanence. The
prominent Swiss psychologist
[Jean Piaget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget), whose theories on
child development popularized the idea of object permanence, claimed that it
began to develop at eight to twelve months. However,
[recent studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence#Contradicting_evidence)
have shown that it may exist in children as young as three months old. Some
posit that it may begin to develop even before birth.

Similarly, we don't know all of the details about how it develops. It's almost
certainly related to the sensory feedback loop of an infant's interaction with
their environment, feeding into the establishment of the neural connections in
the developing frontal cortex. But that leaves many unresolved questions: How
long does it take? Does it develop in specific stages?  What might interfere
with its development? Research continues: the PubMed database lists
[over 100 papers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(%22object%20permanence%22%20AND%20Humans%5BMesh%5D))
related to object permanence in humans (and more in other species) for readers
interested in learning more about studies and thinking on this topic.

Object permanence *does* develop, regardless of when and how. An adult human
with no sense of object permanence wouldn't be able to function.  It may not
develop equally smoothly for everyone, however. My partner, a licensed
therapist who worked in community mental health for a number of years, learned
from a mentor that individuals who tend towards psychosis often have behaviors
that hint at a tenuous sense of object permanence. She learned to watch for
clients who would avidly "take in" the surroundings of her office every time
they entered, as if to ascertain whether or not they had been there
before. They would often be hyper-aware if anything had changed... "Was that
picture always on that desk?"

The implication here is that these clients' sense of the permanence of the
environment might be impaired. Every time they entered her office, they were
trying to establish whether this was indeed the place they had been before, or
if somehow it were fundamentally different. Consistency is very desirable with
such clients, so she would work to ensure they could always meet at the same
time, on the same day(s), to reinforce that the therapy sessions happen in a
persistent reality that can be trusted to continuously exist.

There is still much to learn about how object permanence develops, and about
the impact of snags in that process. Even so, it seems safe to guess that poor
object permanence has a negative impact on adult functioning, so it's a good
idea to provide children with supportive conditions. A safe environment for
exploring and interacting, which allows them to establish connections between
their sensory and motor systems, is one crucial piece. Lots of attuned human
interaction is also important, as no other "objects" contribute more to a
baby's development than the people in its life.
