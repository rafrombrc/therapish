[Object permanence]({{< relref "object_permanence.md" >}}) refers to the
ability to know something continues to exist even when it is not being
perceived. Often confused with object permanence is the related idea of "object
constancy", which moves beyond merely recognizing an object's permanent
existence and on to understanding that a single object can contain a multitude
of (sometimes disparate) traits. Knowing that a book still exists even though
it's hidden behind my back shows object permanence; knowing that the book is
the same object whether you're seeing it standing vertically on the shelf or
laying on the floor with the pages splayed open shows object constancy.

When psychologists speak of object constancy, however, books are not usually
what they have in mind. People are objects, too, and our relationships to
people have a much larger impact on our development of self, especially our
parents or primary caregivers. This is not terribly surprising, given the
abject helplessness of the human infant. Our survival is *completely* dependent
on our caregivers, so we are hard wired to a) figure out who they are and b)
bond with or "attach to" them as effectively as possible.

Realizing the constancy of a parent figure does not happen all at once. Our
experience of a caregiver is made up of a variety of phenomena. A newborn will
usually experience breastfeeding, with its soft touches and warmth and
nourishing sweetness. They may also experience being tickled, with the tactile
sensation of gently poking fingers and the reflexive laughter response. The
child will develop a relationship to each of these experiences, but it may not
put it together that one single "Mama" object is behind both of those
experiences.

Another axis of object constancy is that one object can generate both
gratifying and frustrating experiences. Imagine a mother with one breast that
produces an abundance of milk, while the other underproduces. An infant may
initially experience these as two separate objects: "good breast", to which the
child has a positive response; and "bad breast", to which the child develops an
aversion.

In healthy development, this gets resolved. The good and the bad are joined as
we come to realize that a constant mother object contains both. These ideas are
central to the work of early psychoanalyst
[Margaret Mahler's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mahler), who
describes further a process where the child, having realized the mother exists
outside of self, develops an "internalization", or internal representation, of
that mother. Internalization is thought to be very important to an infant's
well being. The internalized mother object provides a level of safety, support,
and reassurance to the baby, supporting a higher capacity for tolerating
challenges and discomfort as it moves through its world.

Devlopment of object constancy does not always go perfectly well,
unfortunately. If a parent intermingles abuse with the necessary acts of care
required for keeping a baby alive, that baby will probably have a very hard
time reconciling those experiences and recognizing that one entity is
responsible for both the nurture and the torture. This inability to integrate
the experiences into a single object can have long lasting effects, possibly
leading to an adult who has a hard time seeing others in all their
fullness. This person will tend to experience those around them as either all
good (idealization) or all bad (vilification), or maybe even vascillating
between the two. It would be hard for them, however, to have a nuanced
experience of a complete other, simlutaneously containing both positive and
negative traits.

A parent figure's lack of object constancy also impacts the internalization of
that parent figure. The internal representation that the child carries around
will also be fragmented, and it will not as effectively provide the child with
a sense of support and security. A child so deprived of this resource will
likely grow into an adult who feels a heightened fear of abandonment,
ultimately unsafe and alone in the world.

With this in mind it's not surprising that object constancy issues are thought
to be linked to what is called "borderline" behavior. Among the symptoms of
[Borderline Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms)
are disturbed sense of identity, extreme reactions to real or imagined
abandonment, "black and white" thinking, and uncontrollable emotional reactions
that seem disproportionate to an event or situation. It's as though the folks
with a healthy sense of object constancy are always carrying a reassuring
mother around with them, a mother that can hold them and whisper words of
encouragement and safety. Aloneness is tolerable when you always have this
internalized mother inside of you. The poor souls with impaired object
constancy feel profoundly alone inside of themselves. They are terrified of the
possibility, and have a hard time tolerating the reality, of any loss of
external connection.
