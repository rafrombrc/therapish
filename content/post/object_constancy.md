INCOMPLETE -- WORK IN PROGRESS


The most impactful "objects" that we experience are our parents, or (if they're
not around) whoever is in the role of primary caregiver. This is not terribly
surprising, especially when you consider the abject helplessness of the human
infant. Our survival is *completely* dependent on our caregivers, so we are
hard wired to a) figure out who they are and b) bond with or "attach to" them
as effectively as possible.

But the permanence of the parent figure does not happen all at once. Our
experience of a caregiver is made up of a number of often dissimilar phenomena.
For instance, to a newborn infant there can be an experience of breastfeeding,
with its soft touches and warmth and nourishing sweetness. There might also be
an experience of being tickled, made up of some strange poking sensations and a
reflexive laughter response. An infant will develop a relationship to the
experience of nursing. Another will be developed to the experience of being
tickled. But both of those will likely have existed for a while before the baby
puts together that one single "Mama" object is behind both of those
experiences.

Object constancy does not always develop without a hitch. Sometimes a mother
can have one breast that produces an abundance of milk, and another that
underproduces. There are similarities in the two experiences, but while one is
satisfying and nourishing, the other is frustrating and fails to replenish. It
might take a child a while to realize that these are in fact a single
phenomenon, or that there is a single entity behind both breasts. The bountiful
breast becomes one object, desirable, and the less abundant one becomes
another, to which the baby might develop an aversion.

In healthy development, this gets resolved. Eventually the good breast and the
bad breast are joined as part of the single mother object. The less similar the
experiences, however, the harder it is for them to be resolved into a single
object. If an infant's parent intermingles physical abuse of some sort with the
necessary acts of care required for keeping a baby alive, the infant will have
a very hard time reconciling these experiences, and it may be quite some time
before we realize that the caregiver and the torturer are one and the same.

In fact, in some sense this may never happen. As years pass, the frontal cortex
comes online and we intellectually realize that there is a single other who has
inconsistent behavior. But we might not internalize this into ourselves at a
more fundamental layer. And, since our own adult self is developed in response
and relation to the others that we encounter, we might end up with different
parts of ourselves never cohering into one. This is what is commonly referred
to as "fragmentation", and may lead to undesirable psychic experiences such as
psychosis.
